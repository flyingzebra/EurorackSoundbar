# EurorackSoundbar
Purpose: Manufacture a speaker and synth in one enclosure, and make it fit right behind ones midi keyboard.

# Background story
It all started with buying an all-in-one furnished hammer action piano with built-in synth,
and not surporisingly, regretting 25 years later all the electronics inside have become old and boring.
That said, I thought, while mechanics, furniture and sensor technology - to some extent - usually come with a built quality to withstand decades of keyboard playing, electronics inside are fashion-sensitive; their lifetime depend on trends, standards, genres, and innovations.
I long thought about flining out the guts out of my good old digital Yamaha Clavinova from past century, but then I had a better idea: 
1) Buy a decent MIDI hammer-action keyboard (everyone knows how to do that)
2) Design a soundbar with built-in space for replacable electronics : A Eurorack soundbar!
