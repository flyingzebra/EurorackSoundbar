# Eurorack Soundbar
Goal: A table for a MIDI keyboard with fitting speaker & modular electronics like synth, amp, anything!

# Background story
It all started with buying an all-in-one furnished hammer-action piano with built-in synth, and not surporisingly, regretting 25 years later all the electronics inside have become old and boring.  That said, I thought, while mechanics, furniture and sensor technology - to some extent - usually come with a built quality to withstand decades of keyboard playing, electronics inside are fashion-sensitive; their lifetime depend on trends, standards, genres, and innovations.  I long thought about flining out the guts out of my good old digital Yamaha Clavinova from past century, but then came a better idea: 
1) Buy a decent MIDI hammer-action keyboard (everyone knows how to do that; I fell for a KAWAI VPC1.
2) Design a slim, good-looking table on wheels carrying about 30Kg=66lbs of keyboard and another 20Kg=44lbs of soundbar.
3) Design a soundbar including a standardised built-in space for replacable electronics : A Eurorack Soundbar as it were!

# Furniture requirements
1) Elegant & aesthetic, fitting ones living room.
2) Providing table surface fitting Piano Keyboard + Soundbar.
3) Sturdy enough to carry 50Kg=110lbs.
4) Providing maximum leg space horizontally and vertically.
5) Height-adjustable to some extent.

This sketch, for what it's worth, outlines all elements including the Piano; exact measures and additional features however will come later; they obviously depend on the keyboard one has purchased.

# Speaker enclosure - passive part - requirements
1) Perfectly fitting keyboard width, and height aligned with the top of the speaker grills.
2) Best compromise between good bass production and small enclosure volume.
3) Rich sound spectrum and spatial perception ideal for instrument sound reproduction.
4) Optional built-in passive filter.
5) Die-cast, anti-reflection and airleak-proof speaker enclosure.
6) Vibration isolation between table & enclosure.
7) Does not vibrate or glide off the table.
8) Re-openable, allowing replacement of speakers provided with inside fixture.
9) All speaker leads and filter leads come straight out of the pressure cabinet. (No electrical circuits inside)
10) One common connector (male part) providing electrically separate access to all enclosed speakers and filters.

# Electronics enclosure - active part- requirements
1) Common connector (female part, heading towards the amplifier) with dispatching jumpers 
2) Standard Eurorack frame housing 3U 84HP (decisive for speaker enclosure depth)
3) Eurorack power source (Low noise 15-35V source for Amps, 5V & 3V3 regulated source for MCU's and controllers)
