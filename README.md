# Eurorack Soundbar
Goal: A table for a MIDI keyboard with fitting speaker & modular electronics like synth, amp, anything!

# Background story
It all started with buying an all-in-one furnished hammer-action piano with built-in synth,and not surporisingly, regretting 25 years later all the electronics inside have become old and boring.  That said, I thought, while mechanics, furniture and sensor technology - to some extent - usually come with a built quality to withstand decades of keyboard playing, electronics inside are fashion-sensitive; their lifetime depend on trends, standards, genres, and innovations.  I long thought about flining out the guts out of my good old digital Yamaha Clavinova from past century, but then I came a better idea: 
1) Buy a decent MIDI hammer-action keyboard (everyone knows how to do that; I fell for a KAWAI VPC1)
2) Design a slim, good-looking table on wheels carrying about 30Kg=66lbs of keyboard and another 20Kg=44lbs of soundbar.
3) Design a soundbar including a standardised built-in space for replacable electronics : A Eurorack Soundbar as it were!

# Furniture requirements
1) Elegant & aesthetic, fitting ones living room after all.
2) Sturdy enough to carry 50Kg=110lbs
4) Providing maximum leg space horizontally and vertically
5) Height-adjustable to some extent

The exact measures and additional features will come later.
